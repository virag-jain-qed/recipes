# Route definitions for the anytown module.

# Each route needs a unique identifier. We recommend prefixing the route name
# with the name of your module. Indented under the route name is the definition
# of the route. A routing.yml file can contain any number of routes.
anytown.weather_page:
  # The URL path where this page will be displayed. {style} represents a
  # placeholder and will be populated by whatever is entered into that position
  # of the URL. Its value is passed the controller's build method.
  path: '/weather/{style}'
  defaults:
    # Title of the page used for things like <title> tag.
    _title: 'Weather at the market'
    # Defines which method, on which class, should be called to retrieve the
    # content of the page.

    # Default value for {style} if it's not present.
